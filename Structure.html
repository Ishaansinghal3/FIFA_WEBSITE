<font size="6"><u><b>FIFA COUNCIL</b></u></font><br><br>
<font size="5">The FIFA Council (formerly the FIFA Executive Committee) is an institution of FIFA (the governing body of association football, futsal and beach football). It is the main decision-making body of the organization in the intervals of FIFA Congress. Its members are elected by the FIFA Congress. The council is a non-executive, supervisory and strategic body that sets the vision for FIFA and global football.<br><br>
Following the 2016 FIFA Extraordinary Congress, FIFA announced that a new set of statutes would come into force. These changes have seen the FIFA Executive Committee changed, to become the FIFA Council, with a new structure, and more power. It is led by the President of FIFA. It has also been announced that the Secretary General will now report to the council, and will work with a Chief Compliance Officer, who monitors the organisation in their work. All existing members of the committee remained in role until their respective positions faced re-election at their respective confederations. The new members of the FIFA Council came into force on 30 September 2016. There is a total of 37 new members on the council. It came into force before the 2016 Ordinary FIFA congress.<br><br>
The new council will be made up of the following individuals:
<ul>
<li>The President</li>
<li>CONMEBOL: one vice-president and four members</li>
<li>AFC: one vice-president and six members</li>
<li>UEFA: three vice-presidents and six members</li>
<li>CAF: one vice-president and six members</li>
<li>CONCACAF: one vice-president and four members</li>
<li>OFC: one vice-president and two members</li>
</ul><br>
<font size="6"><u><b>FORMER STRUCTURE</b></u></font><br>
<p>The executive committee consisted of a president, elected by the Congress in the year following a FIFA World Cup, eight vice-presidents and 15 members, appointed by the confederations and associations, and one female member elected by the Congress. In addition to that, in 2013 two more women were co-opted into the executive committee for a period of one year by the Congress, and again in 2014.<br><br>

The term of office is four years. After those four years, the members as well as the vice-presidents can be re-appointed by their confederations and associations and re-installed by the Congress for another four-year period. Also the President can be re-elected by the congress. Each member has one vote in the committee, including the President, who has, however, a casting vote if the original vote is a draw. All members of the executive committee, after having been chosen by the Congress, can only be removed from their position, if either the Congress or the confederation to which the member belongs, decides that a change of personnel is necessary. For each country's football association only one member can serve on the Execute Committee. Should the President be temporarily or permanently impeded to fulfill his role, the most senior vice-president takes over his responsibilities until a new president can be elected by the Congress.<br><br>

All candidates for the executive committee should not be delegates for their associations. All members must pass an integrity check before they can be elected. The integrity checks for the vice-presidents and other members of the executive committee are conducted by their own confederations. The President, the female member of the executive committee, all members of the judicial bodies as well as those of the FIFA Audit and Compliance Committee are checked by the investigatory chamber of the FIFA Ethics Committee. Before a member can be re-elected, another integrity check must be conducted.<br><br>


It meets at least twice a year, with the mandate for each member lasting four years, and its role includes determining the dates, locations and format of tournaments, appointing FIFA delegates to the IFAB and electing and dismissing the General Secretary on the proposal of the FIFA President. Between 1947 and 2013, officially one of the vice-presidents had to be from one of the British associations. This guaranteed position was officially removed by FIFA in 2013 but unofficially maintained by UEFA only nominating British candidates for any vacancies.</p></font>
